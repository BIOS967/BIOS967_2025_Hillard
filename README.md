Cooccurrence Structure of Diet Guilds Across Pleistocene-Holocene Transition



Thomas Hillard



This project uses a presence-absence matrix of North American mammals that is used for the cooccurrence analysis we are doing. This csv, called Complete PAtable in the data folder, is a matrix with all the species in the analysis and all the sites in the analysis with a 0 meaning absent and a 1 meaning present. The age of each site is also listed. 



We combined this with diet data that was mostly obtained through the MOM database and the Paleobiology database, as well as the general paleobiology literature. The diet data is in the csv file TraitdataTestVersion in the data folder. This has a column for the species name that is in the presence-absence matrix as well as the modern species name if taxonomy was updated and what diet category it is. 



We also saved the results of the COoccurrence analysis in the Data folder as it takes time to run. We saved this as a file Cooctotals in the data folder.
